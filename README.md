### Eureka! moment
#### If you plan to only audit class, one thing to focus on
* Although radiology image classification and segmentation using a CNN in TensorFlow is interesting, survival analysis using different traditional ML methods are a nice comparison and contrast between modern and classical AI, ML and DL approaches.

### Key Takeaways
* In Healthcare, there are common data challenges of: data access, data size, and data quality.
* Validation need clear methods, evaluation metrics and explanation.
* Despite the hype of AI and deep learning (DL), traditionl ML methods (e.g, decision trees, random forest) still very effective in real world scenarios.
